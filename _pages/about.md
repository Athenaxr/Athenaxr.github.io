I am a PhD student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EDEE) at [√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland. I work under the supervision of [Prof. Manuel Guizar-Sicairos](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cxi/prof-manuel-guizar-sicairos/) in the [Computational X-ray Imaging Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cxi/), based at the [Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)](https://www.psi.ch/en) 
My research lies at the intersection of computational imaging and machine learning, with a particular focus on developing AI-driven solutions to address fundamental challenges in high-resolution 3D brain imaging.

Prior to joining EPFL, I obtained my Master‚Äôs degree from Tsinghua University, where I was advised by Prof. Kai Zhang and Prof. Xian Tang. I earned my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Technology from Northeast Petroleum University.
